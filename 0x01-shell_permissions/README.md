#H1 Shell Permissions
This project folder demonstrates knowledge and understanding in Shell (*Bash*) Permissions. 

I explore commands such as:
- chown
- chgrp
- su
- id
- whoami
- groups
- adduser
- useradd
- addgroup
- sudo

Additionally, I delve into the octal notation method of assigning permissions to **owner users (u)**, **group users (g)**, and **others (o)**
